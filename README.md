A simple prayer times application made during my free time while studying computer science at UCF. My main objective was to gain experience with iOS development. This particular app was made using SwiftUI, and a negligable amount of Objective-C.
Around July 2022, this app was briefly avaiable on the app store, but I took it down because I noticed many bugs.
